    title: '2025 Updating the ICF Core Competencies',
    definition:
      'The primary objective in undertaking the 2025 global coaching job analysis was to understand how coaching practice has evolved since the previous job analysis in 2019. The aim was to identify any new competencies that are now essential for coaches, to determine any competencies that are no longer relevant, and revise existing competencies where necessary. Updates to the ICF Core Coaching Competency model were made through rigorous, evidence-based methods to assess how the Knowledge, Abilities, and Other Characteristics (KAOs) of coaching have changed.\n\nThe 14-month job analysis used a variety of methods, including literature reviews, focus groups, analyses of tasks and knowledge, abilities, and other characteristics (KAOs), surveys, and a review of the existing competency model. These approaches were designed to (a) identify changes in the coaching profession since the last update in 2019 and (b) determine how those changes could guide updates to ICF’s competency model. This competency model is based on the data collected from nearly 3,000 coaches across the world, including both ICF Members and non-members and representing a diverse range of coaching disciplines, training backgrounds, coaching styles and experience levels.\n\nWhile no new main competencies are introduced, five new sub-competencies have been added, and revisions have been made to 11 existing sub-competencies.',
